      "Search" for podcasts is still an area of active development and there's a lot of room for
      improvement. At the moment, finding podcasts on related topics is very tedious.

      This project is a proof-of-concept for using semantic search on podcast descriptions to find
      similar topics. Here, I pulled all episodes from one of my favorite podcasts (HIBT) and
      attempted to see if I could find similarities in the episodes.
